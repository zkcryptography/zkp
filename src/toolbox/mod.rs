//! Contains lower-level tools that allow programmable specification
//! of proof statements.
//!
//! The higher-level [`define_proof`] macro allows declarative
//! specification of static proof statements, and expands into code
//! that uses this lower-level API.  This lower-level API can also be
//! used directly to perform imperative specification of proof
//! statements, allowing proof statements with runtime parameters
//! (e.g., an anonymous credential with a variable number of
//! attributes).
//!
//! The `SchnorrCS` trait defines the common constraint system API
//! used for specifying proof statements; it is implemented by the
//! `Prover`, `Verifier`, and `BatchVerifier` structs.
//!
//! Roughly speaking, the tools fit together in the following way:
//!
//! * Statements are defined as generic functions which take a
//! `SchnorrCS` implementation and some variables,
//! and add the proof statements to the constraint system;
//!
//! * To create a proof, construct a `Prover`,
//! allocate and assign variables, pass the prover and the variables
//! to the generic statement function, then consume the prover to
//! obtain a proof.
//!
//! * To verify a proof, construct a `Verifier`,
//! allocate and assign variables, pass the verifier and the variables
//! to the generic statement function, then consume the verifier to
//! obtain a verification result.
//!
//! Note that the expansion of the [`define_proof`] macro contains a
//! public `internal` module with the generated proof statement
//! function, making it possible to combine generated and hand-crafted
//! proof statements into the same constraint system.

/// An interface for specifying proof statements, common between
/// provers and verifiers.
///
/// The variables for the constraint system are provided as associated
/// types, allowing different implementations to have different point
/// and scalar types.  For instance, the batch verifier has two types
/// of point variables, one for points common to all proofs in the
/// batch, and one for points varying per-proof.
///
/// This is why variable allocation is *not* included in the trait, as
/// different roles may have different behaviour -- for instance, a
/// prover needs to supply assignments to the scalar variables, but
/// a verifier doesn't have access to the prover's secret scalars.
///
/// To specify a proof statement using this trait, write a generic
/// function that takes a constraint system as a parameter and adds
/// the statements.  For instance, to specify an equality of discrete
/// logarithms, one could write
/// ```rust,ignore
/// fn dleq_statement<CS: SchnorrCS>(
///     cs: &mut CS,
///     x: CS::ScalarVar,
///     A: CS::PointVar,
///     G: CS::PointVar,
///     B: CS::PointVar,
///     H: CS::PointVar,
/// ) {
///     cs.constrain(A, vec![(x, B)]);
///     cs.constrain(G, vec![(x, H)]);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This means that multiple statements can be added to the same
/// proof, independently of the specification of the statement, by
/// constructing a constraint system and then passing it to multiple
/// statement functions.
